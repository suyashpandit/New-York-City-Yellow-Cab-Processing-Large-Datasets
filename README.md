# New-York-City-Yellow-Cab-Processing-Large-Datasets
NYC Yellow Cab is a big company run by NYC Taxi Cab Commission which handles many cabs and medallions each year. There are millions of trips every month with hundreds of millions of revenue. Raw data is all over the place and too messy. Cleaning and analyzing this data helps NYC stakeholders to see the details of these trips and revenue.
